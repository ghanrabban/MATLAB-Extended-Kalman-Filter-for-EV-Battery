# MATLAB Extended Kalman Filter for Battery State of Charge Estimation

The following code, along with the [accompanying files](https://github.com/ghanrabban/MATLAB-Feedforward-Deep-Neural-Network-for-EV-Battery), constitutes the primary dataset for the forthcoming research titled "DSP-Based Estimation of Battery State of Charge: Comparative Study on Extended Kalman Filter and Feedforward Deep Neural Networks," which will be published in the Heliyon Open Journal.

This code is a modified version of the original work by Fauzia Khanum et al. from McMaster University, titled [State of Charge Estimation Function based on Kalman Filter](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/90381-state-of-charge-estimation-function-based-on-kalman-filter)

Several modifications have been made to adapt the code to a different battery dataset from the same university, which is available on [Mendeley Data - Samsung INR21700 30T 3Ah Li-ion Battery Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9xyvy2njj3/1).

The "Battery Datasets" folder is divided into "Preprocessed Dataset" and "Raw Dataset" subfolders. The Preprocessed Dataset folder contains a list of input data for machine learning training. Please do not modify these files. The Raw Dataset folder contains the original Samsung INR21700 30T 3Ah Li-ion Battery Dataset.

The "Original Code" folder includes the original works by Fauzia Khanum and her colleagues.

Lastly, the "Simulation Results" folder contains a collection of training results and supplementary data for the research paper.
